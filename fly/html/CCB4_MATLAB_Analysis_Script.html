Such recordings will involve a stimulus - mechanical or electrical - and an electrical response of the cell.  The responses are measured using a glass pipette filled with a saline solution that is connected by a silver chloride wire to a sensitive patch clamp amplifier.  Mechanical stimuli are delivered using a piezoelectric actuator that will push on the fly's antenna.</p><p>First, we will inspect the data managment scheme, how the raw_data is stored and organized when it is recorded.</p><p>Then we will inspect some of these data individually.</p><p>Finally, we will pose an anlysis question and follow a routine to answer the question according to the following steps:  (1) find data that are relevant to the question (2) import the data (3) perform operations on the data (4) display the results.</p><h2>Naming conventions and data management<a name="2"></a></h2><p>Raw data is stored in this repository on my machine at   /Users/tony/Code/Modern-Data-Management/raw_data.

</pre><p>A typical experiment procedes as follows: (1) "mount" a fly in a holder, i.e. put the fly into a piece of aluminum foil that will hold it in position on the microscope, and glue it in place. (2) Dissect the fly's cuticle (head) to expose the brain, place the holder on the microscope. (3) Visualize the cell and patch the neuron of interest. (4) Deliver stimuli of various sorts. (5) If the preparation (prep) is still ok after the first cell, go on to another cell in the same prep.</p><p>Accordingly, I have decided to store raw data in the following way: (A) Within the top level raw_data directory (B) Within a direcotory that refers to the day (YYMMDD) on which I performed the recordings (B) In a directory for Each cell that I record with the naming convention YYMMDD_FX_CY. This choice was influenced by conventions already in place in the lab.  I could have chosen to store each cell in the raw_data folder, but I didn't.</p><pre class="codeinput"><span class="comment">% Look at the contents of the cell directory 131126_F2_C1</span>

The general question I would like to ask is whether different cells are selective for different frequencies of antennal movement.

We will assume that I designed the experiment appropriately and gathered sufficient data to do this.</p><p>What I have done is deliver mechanical stimuli with a range of different frequencies, and with a range of amplitudes (displacements) at each frequency. For each frequency, displacement pair, I have recorded three trials to be able to get an average response.</p><p>So the first goal in the analysis is to find the three trials with the same frequency and displacement.

</pre><p>The extension of the 1D array into multple dimensions is called a matrix.  A matrix is a very convenient data structure to hold multiple rows and columns of NUMERICAL data because you can then do simple mathematical operations on the matrix, along any dimension you choose.</p><p>This is how I will store the voltage responses from each trial: a 2D matrix with 3 rows, one for each trial with a given frequency and displacement, and with 85001 columns, one for each time sample. Then I will be able to take the average of all the trials easily, along the first dimension, as it happens.</p><p>As an extension, if I were analyzing movies, my matrix might consist of image frames as 2D x-y data, with a third dimension as frame number over time.  Or, if it's a color movie, I might have a 4D matrix: x,y,color,time. etc.</p><p>MATLAB (MATrix LABoratory) was designed for this.</p><p>As for the cell array: whereas the matrix can only hold numeric data, the cell array is a generic structure that can hold anything you want: numbers, strings, other cell arrays, anything.  It can also be as many dimensions as you like. So it's a flexible data structure. It's just not good for holding numeric data because you wouldn't be able to perform mathematical operations on it, it's not built for that.</p><p>For the data structure called a "MATLAB" structure, we have seen an example of its advantage while we were using   params : We can get values out by just calling the field name.  This lets you group a bunch of things under one variable, and it doens't matter whether they are strings or numeric types or even cell arrays or other structures.</p><p>So, choosing a matrix to hold my trial data is an example of the decisions I have to make when managing data.</p><p>Anyways...</p><h2>Finding relevant trials<a name="38"></a></h2><p>For illustration purposes, we will clear the workspace of all its data and also make sure we are still in the right data folder</p><pre class="codeinput">clear

I might also search through the files in this directory, using code like below, and find trials that have identical parameters (except for trial number). But you can do this however you like.</p><h2>Loading Data<a name="41"></a></h2><p>For each trial number in my set, I will create the file name for that trial and load it into a new variable, called trial. For example</p><pre class="codeinput">trial_file_name = <span class="keyword">...</span>

I also know how long the voltage traces will be because all the trials were run the same way and we have already played with one.

%% Data Management in MATLAB
% copyright: Anthony Azevedo, 2014

%% Introduction
% This script will explore electrophyiological recordings of cells in
% the auditory pathway of "the fly", Drosophila melanogaster.  Such
% recordings will involve a stimulus - mechanical or electrical - and an
% electrical response of the cell.  The responses are measured using a
% glass pipette filled with a saline solution that is connected by a silver
% chloride wire to a sensitive patch clamp amplifier.  Mechanical stimuli
% are delivered using a piezoelectric actuator that will push on the fly's
% antenna.
%
% First, we will inspect the data managment scheme, how the raw_data is
% stored and organized when it is recorded.   
%
% Then we will inspect some of these data individually.
%
% Finally, we will pose an anlysis question and follow a routine to answer
% the question according to the following steps:  (1) find data that are
% relevant to the question (2) import the data (3) perform operations on
% the data (4) display the results.

%% Naming conventions and data management
% Raw data is stored in this repository on my machine at 
%   /Users/tony/Code/Modern-Data-Management/raw_data.
% The fullfile function creates a string for the path to a directory.

clear % clears the "workspace"
raw_data_directory = fullfile('~','Code','Modern-Data-Management','raw_data'); 
cd(raw_data_directory)
pwd


%%
% A typical experiment procedes as follows: 
% (1) "mount" a fly in a holder, i.e. put the fly into a piece of aluminum
% foil that will hold it in position on the microscope, and glue it in
% place. 
% (2) Dissect the fly's cuticle (head) to expose the brain, place the
% holder on the microscope. 
% (3) Visualize the cell and patch the neuron of interest.
% (4) Deliver stimuli of various sorts.
% (5) If the preparation (prep) is still ok after the first cell, go on to
% another cell in the same prep.
%
% Accordingly, I have decided to store raw data in the following way:
% (A) Within the top level raw_data directory
% (B) Within a direcotory that refers to the day (YYMMDD) on which I
% performed the recordings
% (B) In a directory for Each cell that I record with the naming
% convention YYMMDD_FX_CY. 
% This choice was influenced by conventions already in place in the lab.  I
% could have chosen to store each cell in the raw_data folder, but I
% didn't.  

% Look at the contents of the cell directory 131126_F2_C1
experimentdate = '131126';
flynumber = '2';
cellnumber = '1';

cellIdentifier = [experimentdate '_F' flynumber '_C' cellnumber]

celldirectory = fullfile(raw_data_directory,experimentdate,cellIdentifier)

% Move to that folder;
cd(celldirectory)

% list the contents
ls

% You will see a list of ".mat" files.  These are files of data that
% matlab creates using the "save" function.  You can read these files using
% the "load" function.

%% Inspect data from a single trial

load('PiezoSine_Raw_131126_F2_C1_3.mat')

%%
% The naming conventions of the .mat files gives information about how
% these data were collected.  
%
% The first part is the name of the stimulus protocol that was used to
% produce a stimulus, in this case "PiezoSine", or a sine wave mechanical
% stimulus delivered through the piezo electric actuator. I define a
% protocol as a collection of parameters used to 
% construct the stimulus in the first place (at acquisition), and to
% reconstruct it post-hoc (during analysis).  
%
% The "Raw" signifier indicates this is a single trial.  Trials are the
% units of acquired data and represent a single presentation of a
% particular stimulus.  
%
% Next comes the cell identifier
%
% Finally, the last number is the protocol trial number (3 of 45 in this
% case)
%
% When we loaded the trial, several new variables were created in the
% workspace
whos  % displays the variables in the workspace

%% 
% These are:
%
%%       
% The path to the raw file on PC work station.  Original path is to a folder
% called Acquisition, where newly acquired data is stored.
name

%%
% A built-in data structure called a "Matlab structure" (help struct) which
% has "fields" ("gain","mode", etc) and "values". You'll see how to use
% this below.
params

%%
% A built-in "cell array" (help cell) called tags that will hold any information about
% this particular trial that I may have entered while acquiring (e.g.
% application of drugs, washout of drugs, etc)
tags

%%
% The measurement of current over time (A large 1D array)

% I could call length(current) too.
size(current)

%%
% The measurement of voltage over time (A large 1D array)
size(voltage)

%%
% And the measurement of a strain gauge on the piezo actuator over time (A
% large 1D array). 
% This let's me know what the probe pushing the antenna is actually doing,
% which can 
% be different than the stimulus I wanted.
size(sgsmonitor)


%% The original stimulus
% The params structure will tell us how the stimulus and response were
% generated and collected.  I created the acquisition system to use these
% numbers, and these are my choices of what to call these numbers.  They
% are not universal vocabulary, just my preferences and design, but they
% represent standard quantities that such an acquisition system would need.
params

%%
% The following parameters define how the stimulus evolves over time.


%%
% the sampling rate of the stimulus command.  A digitial to analog
% converter will produce a continuous analog signal based on a digital
% command from the computer
params.samprateout  

%%
% seconds before the stimulus actually starts
params.preDurInSec

%%
% seconds that the stimulus will be presented
params.stimDurInSec

%%
% seconds after the stimulus before the trial ends
params.postDurInSec

%%
% This is just the sum of the previous three.
params.durSweep

%% 
% With these numbers, we can create a vector representing time.  This is
% the time base for the stimulus.
number_of_samples = params.durSweep*params.samprateout;
time_stim = (0:number_of_samples);  
% a vector with 85001 entries.  Note, I started at 0.  This may be dumb,
% but it was intuitive to me, and I just have to be consistent.

time_stim = time_stim/params.samprateout;
% a time vector beginning at 0, ending at 1.7 sec.  
time_stim(1)
time_stim(end)  % Careful: end has two meanings, as you'll see below.

diff(time_stim(1:2)) % "diff" finds the difference between entries in a vector
% each entry is 2e-5 seconds apart, which would give you 50k samples per
% second

%%
% Subtract off the pre period so the stimulus starts at time = 0
time_stim = time_stim - params.preDurInSec;

%%
% Use logical operations to learn about the vector
sum(time_stim < 0)
% 2000 samples before the stimulus starts
sum(time_stim >= 0 & time_stim < params.stimDurInSec)
% 15001 stimulus samples

sum(time_stim > params.stimDurInSec)
% 50000 points after the stimulus is over

%%
% Next I'll create the stimulus from the params structure. 
% The PiezoSine Protocol defines a sine wave stimulus using the following
% parameters
params.protocol


params.freq
% the frequency of the sine wave

params.displacement
% the amplitude.  This is a mechanical stimulus, so the displacement tells
% us how far the piezo moves.

params.displacementOffset
% This will offset our stimulus a certain amount

params.ramptime
% I don't want the sine wave to start right away, so I have a little
% ramping time to get to full amplitude.


%%
% You can safely skim the next section. This is code from the acquisition
% routines and is somewhat separate.
% The stimulus vector is first a vector of zeros the same size as time
stim = time_stim;
stim(1,:) = 0;

%%
% Then I Find the elements in the stim array that will contain the stimulus
% i.e. entries 20001, through 35000 (20001:35000)
stimpnts = round(params.samprateout*params.preDurInSec+1:...
    params.samprateout*(params.preDurInSec+params.stimDurInSec));

%%
% This creates a "window" that ramps at the begining and the end of the
% stimlus, and put the window into an array where the stimulus will be.
% This uses fairly advanced syntax, you can figure out what it
% does as an exercise.
% Just take a look to see what we're working with.
stimwindow = stim;
w = window(@triang,2*params.ramptime*params.samprateout);
w = [w(1:params.ramptime*params.samprateout);...
    ones(length(stimpnts)-length(w),1);...
    w(params.ramptime*params.samprateout+1:end)];

stimwindow(stimpnts) = w;
figure  % makes a new figure window
plot(time_stim,stimwindow)    % see the ramping on and off?.

%%
% Now create a sine wave
% ... and do element wise multiplication of the window and the sine wave.
% This puts zeros in the pre and post periods and a stimulus where it
% belongs.  Add on the offset. 

sinewave = params.displacement * sin(2*pi * params.freq * time_stim);

stim = sinewave .* stimwindow;

stim = stim + params.displacementOffset;

figure
plot(time_stim,stimwindow)    % see the ramping on and off?.
hold on     % keep all the lines on the plot
plot(time_stim,stim,'r') % plot in red


%% Look at the Response
%
% Several other parameters in the params structure are specific to respons
% acquisition, some 
% are for documentation only (gain, secondary_gain, Vm_id).
%
% The mode indicates whether we were looking at voltage or current of the
% cell

params.mode

%%
% In IClamp mode, I control the current injected into the cell through my
% patch pipette, while I record voltage.
%
% First we need a response time vector.  This could have a different
% sampling rate than the stimulus, though not in this case.  This is called
% sampratein, because the data is coming into the computer in this step.

number_of_samples = params.durSweep*params.sampratein;
time_resp = (0:number_of_samples);  

time_resp = time_resp/params.sampratein;
time_resp = time_resp - params.preDurInSec;

%%
% First, the sgsmonitor (the strain gauge sensor monitor) reports the actual
% position of the probe, which is delayed relative to the stimulus itself,
% so it's important to see the difference.

figure
plot(time_stim,stim,'r') % plot in red
hold on     % keep all the lines on the plot
plot(time_resp,sgsmonitor,'k')
xlim([-.01 .2]);


%%
% Now plot the response in a new figure
figure
plot(time_resp,voltage);

%%
% This is the voltage response of the cell when I move the antenna with 
% the stimulus we created above.
% Admitedly, this looks like a bunch of hash and is somewhat unimpressive.
% Just hold tight.
%
% Alternative display ideas:


figure
subplot(2,1,1)  % help subplot
plot(time_resp,sgsmonitor)

subplot(2,1,2)  
plot(time_resp,voltage)

% The stimulus and sgsmonitor are in V, the command and signal from the
% actuator.  The actual diplacement of the probe comes from converting to
% microns 
displacement_in_microns_per_volt = 3;

subplot(2,1,1)  
title([params.protocol ' stimulus: ',...
    num2str(params.freq) ' Hz, ',...
    num2str(params.displacement * displacement_in_microns_per_volt) ' \mum'])
ylabel('Stimulus command (V)');
xlabel('Time (sec)');

subplot(2,1,2)  
title('Response')
ylabel('Voltage (mV)');
xlabel('Time (sec)');


%% Analysis example
% Finally we would like to use these data to answer a question. The general
% question I would like to ask is whether different cells are selective for
% different frequencies of antennal movement. (To reframe this for an NIH
% fellowship: I will test the hypothesis that different cells have different
% frequency/response relationships)
% Thus, as a specific question,
% I would like to know how a given cell responds to a range of frequencies.
%
% Obviously,
% experimental design is a critical part of being able to answer this specific
% question.  We will assume that I designed the experiment appropriately
% and gathered sufficient data to do this.  
%
% What I have done is deliver mechanical stimuli with a range of different
% frequencies, and with a range of amplitudes (displacements) at each frequency.
% For each frequency, displacement pair, I have recorded three trials to be
% able to get an average response.
%
% So the first goal in the analysis is to find the three trials with the same
% frequency and displacement.  We can see the set of frequencies and
% displacemts because I keep 
% that information in the params matlab structure.
params.freqs

%%
params.displacements

%%
% Then I need to import the data from the raw data files
% into a data structure in matlab that will let me operate on those data
% easily.  


%% Aside about data structures
% "By data structure", I don't necessarily mean I will use matlab structure
% like the params structure we have above, though I could.  
% Data structure is just the general term for how data are
% grouped together. Other data structures we have encountered so farREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH
% besides "matlab" structures, an confusing nameREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH
% include vectors, aka arrays (current, voltage, time)
% and cell arrays (an empty one called tags).  Take a look at the variables
% in the workspace.  Under the class column, you can see the data
% structure type.  
whos

%% 
% The extension of the 1D array into multple dimensions
% is called a matrix.  A matrix is a very convenient data structure to hold
% multiple rows and columns of NUMERICAL data because you can then do simple
% mathematical operations on the matrix, along any dimension you choose.
% 
% This is how I will store the voltage responses from each trial: a 2D
% matrix with 3 rows, one for each trial with a given frequency and
% displacement, and with 85001 columns, one for each time sample.
% Then I will be able to take the average of all the trials
% easily, along the first dimension, as it happens.
%
% As an extension, if I were analyzing movies, my matrix might consist of
% image frames as 2D x-y data, with a third dimension as frame number over
% time.  Or, if it's a color movie, I might have a 4D matrix:
% x,y,color,time. etc.
%
% MATLAB (MATrix LABoratory) was designed for this.
%
% As for the cell array: whereas the matrix can only hold numeric data,
% the cell array is a generic structure that can hold anything 
% you want: numbers, strings, other cell arrays, anything.  It can also be
% as many dimensions as you like. So it's a flexible data structure.  
% It's just not good for holding numeric
% data because you wouldn't be able to perform mathematical operations on
% it, it's not built for that.
%
% For the data structure called a "MATLAB" structure, we have seen an
% example 
% of its advantage while we were using
%   params
% : We can 
% get values out by just calling the field name.  This lets you group a
% bunch of things under one variable, and it doens't matter whether they
% are strings or numeric types or even cell arrays or other structures.
%
% So, choosing a matrix to hold my trial data is an example of the
% decisions I have to make when managing data.
%
% Anyways...

%% Finding relevant trials
% For illustration purposes, we will clear the workspace of all its data
% and also make sure we are still in the right data folder
clear
whos % this doesn't produce any output, there are no variables
pwd % should be: '/Users/tony/raw_data/131126/131126_F2_C1'. If not, navigate there

%%
% From my experimental design, I know that in PiezoSine trials with numbers 
% 1, 16, and 31,
% I delivered a stimulus with a displacement of .1 V and a frequency of 25 Hz.
% This is because I looped over all the displacements at each frequency,
% then changed the frequency, before repeating the whole set.  

trials_25Hz_0_1 = [1 16 31]; % matlab doesn't take variable names with periods

%%
% This is the simplest way of finding data: knowing where it is.  But I
% hate this method, chiefly
% because this often involves looking back and forth from a note book or
% file to my computer to enter numbers that start to confuse me.  I usually
% try to be a little more programatic about it.  If you notice in the 
%   params
% structure, a variable called trial block indicates that a trial belongs
% in a particular set.  I might also search through the files in this
% directory, using code like below, and find trials that have identical
% parameters (except for trial number). But you can do this however you
% like.


%% Loading Data
% For each trial number in my set, I will create the file name for that
% trial and load it into a new variable, called trial. For example
trial_file_name = ...
    ['PiezoSine_Raw_131126_F2_C1_',...
    num2str(trials_25Hz_0_1(3)),...
    '.mat']

trial = load(trial_file_name)

%%
% This is different than when I called "load" before. Now instead of having
% several variables (name, params, voltage...), this imports the trial into
% a new matlab structure with field names for each variable.  Same data,
% different structure!


%%
% I know how many trials I need to import (3).
% I also know how long the voltage traces will be because all the trials
% were run the same way and we have already played with one.  To cut down
% on operations and time, 
% I will create a matrix before I start that will be the same size as the
% one I ultimately need. This is best practices, the technical term is to
% "allocate" memory, or "preallocate" an array

voltage_matrix = zeros(length(trials_25Hz_0_1),length(trial.voltage));
size(voltage_matrix)

%%
% Now I'll loop over the different trials we need.  I'll use a counter,
% trial_index, that will increase by one on each loop, from 1 to 3

for trial_index = 1:length(trials_25Hz_0_1)
    disp(trial_index)
    
    % make the trial filename
    trial_file_name = ...
        ['PiezoSine_Raw_131126_F2_C1_',...
        num2str(trials_25Hz_0_1(trial_index)),... % trial_index changes on each loop
        '.mat']
    
    % load the trial    
    trial = load(trial_file_name);
    
    % just make sure the trial is what I want
    disp(trial.params.freq)
    disp(trial.params.displacement)
    
    % put the voltage trace into the voltage matrix
    voltage_matrix(trial_index,:) = trial.voltage;
end  

%% 
% I re-create the time vector, using the trial structure:
time = (0:1:trial.params.durSweep*trial.params.sampratein)/trial.params.sampratein;
time = time-trial.params.preDurInSec;

%%
% And I take a look at what I have loaded.  When calling "plot", matlab
% assumes the same time base for each y row. Again, not entirely
% satisfying.
figure
plot(time,voltage_matrix); 

%% Operating on the data
% The real operation I want to run is the average along the 1st dimension
% 
mean_voltage_trace = mean(voltage_matrix,1);

%%
% Plot what happened (using a syntax that lets me control the
% color of the lines)

figure

% plot the individual traces in pink
plot(time,voltage_matrix,'color',[1, .7 .7]); 
hold on

% plot the average trace in red
plot(time,mean_voltage_trace,'color',[.7, 0 0]); 

%% 
% What I would like to know is, for this stimulus, what is the amplitude of
% the response?
% I choose to calculate the amplitude as the maximum of the
% response during the stimulus period (between 0 and the stimulus
% duration), minus the average voltage during the 
% base line (time < 0).
% Note, mean_voltage_trace is a 1D vector, so I'm not specifying the
% dimension here
baseline_average = mean(mean_voltage_trace(time < 0));
baseline_average

max_response = max(mean_voltage_trace(time > 0 & time < trial.params.stimDurInSec));
max_response

amplitude_25Hz_0_1 = max_response - baseline_average;
amplitude_25Hz_0_1

%%
% As an exercise, consider that
% I could instead take the average of the maximum amplitudes of each trial,
% but 
% that would give me a different answer


%% Broadening the analysis
% Thus far, I have looked at the lowest frequency and smallest displacement.  
% I will repeat the same procedure with each set of frequencies and
% displacements. 
%
% To do this more programatically, I will loop
% over a collection of trial number vectors like trials_25Hz_0_1. Just as
% for trials_25Hz_0_1, the trials are spaced 15 trials apart for all of the
% other frequencies and displacements.
%
% I can also use the following example syntax:
trials_25Hz_0_1 = (1:15:45)

%% 
% or, I could find find those values programatically, too. This would be
% useful if I for some reason used more or fewer frequencies or
% displacements

number_of_stimuli = ...  % the number of stimuli I will repeate 3 times
    length(trial.params.freqs) * ...
    length(trial.params.displacements)

repetitions = 3


%%
% I'm looking for the amplitude of the average response to each of these
% stimuli, so I want to preallocate a matrix to hold those calculated
% values, and for good measure, redefine 
%   voltage_matrix.

amplitudes = zeros(...
    length(trial.params.freqs),...
    length(trial.params.displacements))

voltage_matrix = zeros(repetitions,length(trial.voltage));


%%
% Now I will create a loop that will use  
%   first_trial_number
% as a counter.  As this increases, it changes 
%   trialnumbers
% to give the trial numbers for the same stimulus trials. I will do the
% same calculation as above, while moving
% along the rows, then columns of the 
% amplitudes matrix to fill it in with each result.

first_trial_number = 0;
for ii = 1:length(trial.params.freqs)
    for jj = 1:length(trial.params.displacements)

        first_trial_number = first_trial_number +1;

        trialnumbers = ...
            (first_trial_number:...
            number_of_stimuli:...
            number_of_stimuli*repetitions);
        
        for trial_index = 1:length(trialnumbers)
            disp(trial_index)
            
            % make the trial filename
            trial_file_name = ...
                ['PiezoSine_Raw_131126_F2_C1_',...
                num2str(trialnumbers(trial_index)),... % trial_index changes on each loop
                '.mat'];
            
            % load the trial
            trial = load(trial_file_name);
            
            % just make sure the trial is what I want
            disp(trial.params.freq)
            disp(trial.params.displacement)
            
            % put the voltage trace into the voltage matrix
            voltage_matrix(trial_index,:) = trial.voltage;

        end
        mean_voltage_trace = mean(voltage_matrix,1);
        baseline_average = mean(mean_voltage_trace(time < 0));

amplitudes

%%
% TA-DAAAH! AND WE HAVE OUR ANSWER!!
% 
% It's hard to see this.  In fact, it's hard to know that we have done
% it correctly.  
% 
% Looking at the amplitude matrix, we see that values tend
% to increase across the columns.  In the loop above, 
%   jj 
% was the index that
% indicated the jj-th column in the ii-th row, and also that 
%   jj 
% increases as
% the displacements go up.  This would seem to make sense: make the
% stimulus larger, and the response should go up.
trial.params.displacements(3)


%% 
% The values going down the row (index 
%    ii 
% increases) seem to hit a peak and
% then decrease 
% again.  This would seem to indicate that a particular frequency would
% produce the largest response.
% Since this is 
%   ii = 3
% , 100 Hz would seem like it should produce the
% largest response
trial.params.freqs(3)

%%
% OK!  Seemed to work, and it appears that this cell is most sensitive to
% frequencies of 100 Hz, or that it's a band pass filter.

%% Displaying Data
% That was kind of a let down.  It could be hocus pocus.  Or a bug.
% We got the answer, I think, but we would also like to <show> that this is
% the case by seeing the goods, plotting the data.
%
% Matlab gives you quite a bit of control over how to produce pretty plots,
% like controlling the color of the lines, and such.
% However, many of these commands can be a bit tricky, and using them is
% part of the art and mastery of matlab programming. Matlab does have a 
% few simple tools to get you started that we'll make use of now.
%
% What would we like to see?  
% 
% I want to see what the averages looked like
% from which the amplitudes were calculated.  I would like to see 
% whether I can detect, by eye, either of the effects we see in the
%   amplitudes
% matrix above. To do this, I'd like to also restrict our view
% to the stimulus time period
%
% I might also like to see which values we used in
% our calulations.  That is, when we find the maximum response amplitude
% during the stimulus, which value did we find?  And also, did we calculate
% the baseline correctly?
%
% Finally, the amplitude matrix is an unsatisfactory representation of this
% measurement. I would like to see the amplitudes plotted in a way that
% makes sense, but also that might tell us more about these frequency
% response functions.
% 
% To do this, I'm going to redo the calculation loop, but while I've got
% the trials loaded, and a matrix of response data for one 
% stimulus, I'm going to plot the responses and their mean, show that I'm
% calculating the baseline correctly, and point out the value I thought was
% the maximum.
% 
% Once this is done, I'll plot the amplitude matrix in an intersting way


% preallocate again (optional)
amplitudes = zeros(...
    length(trial.params.freqs),...
    length(trial.params.displacements))

% I'll take a look at largest 50 Hz stimulus.  That is panel 6, by the

%% Wrap up and future challenges
% This script attempts several things at once.  
%
% (1) It introduces
% the reader/programmer to the basic data directory structure that I have
% found useful for my experiments. 
%
% (2) It walks the reader through an
% example of the smallest data unit that I collect, which consist of
% simultaneous measurements over time of several quantities, usually
% representing a stimulus and a response.
%
% (3) It walks through an analysis work flow that is fairly similar
% every time an analysis gets run (find, load, compute, display), and
% provides example code for running these procedures.
% 
% (4) It tries
% to build from simple matlab structures and syntax into more complex
% commands, including some advanced and hard to read statements that I
% nonetheless use constantly.  
%
% (5) It tries to answer a simple
% biological question that is important to me.
%
% With these goals in mind, I have tried to make it as clear and simple a
% procedure as possible, but I hope that for beginners it's at least a
% little challenging.  I'm appreciative of any feedback, and I'm happy to
% help with any bugs or questions.
% 
% If you are interested, there are many possible ways to go with this
% script to experiment on your own and practice:  
% 
% I have included more data from another
% cell that I recorded. 
% That cell (to give away the punchline), has a different tuning curve, or
% frequency-response relationship. See if you can use the tools here to
% find that answer.
%
% This script only analyzes the data acquired with the PiezoSine stimulus.
% Other protocols were run on the same cell.  With the tools here, you
% should be able to look at the other protocols, particularly the piezo
% protocols where the sgsmonitor is always a representation of the
% stimulus.
%
% I tend to try to make my code more general, sometimes to its detriment,
% so that I can run the same 
% code on more and different types of experiments, say with more values for
% a parameter.  Also, I take advantage of other matlab tools: functions,
% classes, or even using java data structures.  These are things that
% you can try here.  As a start, we went through several loops that called
% essentially the same code.  You could try to turn this code into a
% function that you can call within the loop.
%
% For more fun and real world applications (apps, games, website), I would
% suggest checking out code.org.  That is a blast.
%
% These are definitely languages, it takes patience.  Much success!
